        I have a lot of friends at <a href="https://holo.host/">Holo</a> / <a href="https://holochain.org/">Holochain</a> and I saw one of the designs on their site and got inspired 
        to practice some new skills with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">HTML Canvas</a>
        rendering it in interesting ways. Work in progress.
        <br><br>
        You can tweak the parameters that feed the display below and rerun it for different effects.
